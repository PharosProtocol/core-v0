# Laboratory
The files in this directory exist as placeholders of ideas that could be implemented or as 
proofs of concept demonstrating what would be possible under the permissionless modular
infrastructure paradigm, although it may not yet be possible in the current version of Pharos.
Ideally many of the ideas represented here will be implemented, by the Pharos team or by
third party developers.
